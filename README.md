# saasAiplatform

A TypeScript-first SaaS AI Platform starter — opinionated project scaffold for building, training, and serving ML/AI features in a multi-tenant SaaS environment. This repository contains TypeScript services, web UI components, infrastructure examples, CI workflows, and developer tooling to accelerate building production-ready AI features.

About
-----
saasAiplatform is a template / starter for teams building AI-enabled SaaS products. It focuses on:
- TypeScript-first codebase (backend + frontend)
- Clear patterns for model training, feature stores, and online inference
- Multi-tenant considerations (data isolation, auth)
- Developer experience (local dev, testing, CI)
- Extensible infra examples (Kubernetes, serverless, or managed services)

Features
--------
- TypeScript services for API, worker, and inference runtimes
- Example frontend (React + TypeScript) for admin and demo UIs
- Model training pipeline examples (data ingestion, preprocessing, training, artifact storage)
- Inference service examples for low-latency and batch prediction
- Example integrations: Postgres, Redis, object storage (S3-compatible), and message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- CI pipeline templates (GitHub Actions) for lint, test, build, and deploy
- Utilities for experiment tracking, metrics, and logging
- Authentication & tenant-aware middleware examples

Architecture overview
---------------------
- api/         — REST / GraphQL API service (TypeScript, Node)
- worker/      — background workers for training, batch jobs
- inference/   — low-latency prediction service
- frontend/    — React TypeScript dashboard and demo pages
- libs/        — shared TypeScript libraries (types, auth, tenant utilities)
- infra/       — example IaC (Helm charts, k8s manifests, Terraform examples)
- tests/       — test helpers and integration test scenarios
- docs/        — architecture docs and runbooks

Quick start
-----------

Requirements
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- pnpm (preferred) or npm/yarn
- Docker (for local infra emulation)
- Optional: kubectl and kind / minikube if using local k8s

Local development (short)
1. Clone:
   git clone https://github.com/tanmaydev56/saasAiplatform.git
   cd saasAiplatform

2. Install:
   pnpm install

3. Start local infra (example using Docker Compose):
   cd infra/local
   docker compose up -d

4. Start services:
   pnpm --filter api dev
   pnpm --filter frontend dev
   pnpm --filter inference dev

5. Open the frontend demo:
   http://localhost:3000

These commands assume workspace scripts exist in package.json. See "Key scripts" below for exact commands.

Project layout
--------------
- api/                — Node + TypeScript API (Express/Nest/FASTify)
- frontend/           — React + TypeScript dashboard
- inference/          — inference server (fast, typed endpoints)
- worker/             — training and batch job worker
- libs/               — shared types, utilities, DB clients
- infra/              — local and cloud infrastructure examples
- .github/workflows/  — CI pipeline templates
- package.json / pnpm-workspace.yaml — monorepo workspace config
- README.md           — this file

Key scripts (examples)
- pnpm install
- pnpm build           — build all workspaces
- pnpm dev             — start development across workspaces (or use `pnpm --filter <pkg> dev`)
- pnpm test            — run unit + integration tests
- pnpm lint            — run linters (eslint, prettier)
- pnpm format          — run code formatter
- pnpm infra:local     — start local infra (docker-compose)
- pnpm migrate:up      — run DB migrations

Development workflows
---------------------
- Branching: follow trunk-based or feature-branch workflow as your team prefers.
- PRs: require lint, test, and type-checks to pass before review.
- Semantic commits and conventional commit messages recommended for automated changelogs.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of model-driven features.

Testing
-------
- Unit tests: Jest / Vitest for services and libs
- Integration tests: spin up test containers (testcontainers) or use a local infra compose
- E2E: Puppeteer / Playwright tests for frontend flows that exercise inference end-to-end
- Contract tests: verify API schemas (OpenAPI/GraphQL) against clients

Deployment & infra
------------------
This repo includes example manifests for:
- Docker images for each service
- Kubernetes manifests / Helm charts for production orchestration
- Terraform examples to provision managed services (RDS, S3, Redis, IAM)
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD (build → test → push image → deploy)

Security & multi-tenancy
------------------------
- Tenant isolation: patterns for schema-per-tenant vs shared-schema with tenant_id enforced
- Auth: example JWT or OIDC integration with middleware
- Secrets: store secrets in vault-like solutions (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Data access controls and auditing hooks included in examples

Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome. Suggested steps:
1. Fork the repo and create a branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
2. Run linters and tests locally
3. Open a PR with a clear description and tests for new behavior

Please follow code style, include unit tests for new logic, and update the docs when adding features.
